In this very short project, I have used a MPU6050 for controlling 4 LED’s on the breadboard. The gyroscope is programmed to detect the tilt in the breadboard and then turn on the respective tilted LED.

For the connections.

LED’s :-
const int frontLed = 3;
const int bottomLed = 5;
const int rightLed = 6;
const int leftLed = 9;

And for the MPU6050,
The MPU6050 must be connected to ground and 5V+, after that connect SDA to A4 (analog 4), SCL to A5(analog 5).

 

You are done with the connections now.

Before uploading the code you would require to download 2 libraries.
